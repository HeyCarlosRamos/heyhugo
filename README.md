# Hey Hugo, A theme for [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/)

This is my personal theme for Hugo, the static site generator. This theme is inspired by the [VueJS Guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/), and I'm developing it for the purpose of helping me log my journey in Machine Learning (which I often do on the go). This means the following features are well supported:

- Responsive


## Setup

- Add a `/static/images/favicon.png`


## Config

```toml
    title = {STRING} (optional) The site wide title, also used as the title in the browser tab

    [params]
    logo = {STRING} (optional) The URL to the logo. Defaults to favicon.png
```
